# About Me

Hi, my name is Jolo. I am currently a game development student residing at Lipa, Batangas. I mostly make games in Unity, but I also tend to check out other tech in my free time. Aside from game development, in my free time I play video games (obviously), read manga, watch vtubers, and learn more about tech both in hardware and software.
