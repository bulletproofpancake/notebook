<p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/author/a-adonaac">Written by A Adonaac</a></p>
<p>This post explains a technique for generating randomized dungeons that was first described by <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/278620/">TinyKeepDev</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/">here</a>. I'll go over it in a little more detail than the steps in the original post. The general way the algorithm works is this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wM30Xyl.gif" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="generate-rooms"><a class="header" href="#generate-rooms">Generate Rooms</a></h2>
<p>First you wanna generate some rooms with some width and height that are placed randomly inside a circle. TKdev's algorithm used the normal distribution for generating room sizes and I think that this is generally a good idea as it gives you more parameters to play with. Picking different ratios between width/height mean and standard deviation will generally result in different looking dungeons.</p>
<p>One function you might need to do this is <em>getRandomPointInCircle</em>:</p>
<pre><code>function getRandomPointInCircle(radius)
  local t = 2*math.pi*math.random()
  local u = math.random()+math.random()
  local r = nil
  if u &gt; 1 then r = 2-u else r = u end
  return radius*r*math.cos(t), radius*r*math.sin(t)
end
</code></pre>
<p>You can get more info on how that works exactly <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5837572/generate-a-random-point-within-a-circle-uniformly">here</a>. And after that you should be able to do something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9TsZluP.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>One very important thing that you have to consider is that since you're (at least conceptually) dealing with a grid of tiles you have to snap everything to that same grid. In the gif above the tile size is 4 pixels, meaning that all room positions and sizes are multiples of 4. To do this I wrap position and width/height assignments in a function that rounds the number to the tile size:</p>
<pre><code>function roundm(n, m) return math.floor(((n + m - 1)/m))*m end
</code></pre>
<h2 id="separate-rooms"><a class="header" href="#separate-rooms">Separate Rooms</a></h2>
<p>Now we can move on to the separation part. There's a lot of rooms mashed together in one place and they should not be overlapping somehow. TKdev used the separation steering behavior to do this but I found that it's much easier to just use a physics engine. After you've added all rooms, simply add solid physics bodies to match each room's position and then just run the simulation until all bodies go back to sleep. In the gif I'm running the simulation normally but when you're doing this between levels you can advance the physics simulation faster.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Zv2kYmv.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>The physics bodies themselves are not tied to the tile grid in any way, but when setting the room's position you wrap it with the <em>roundm</em> call and then you get rooms that are not overlapping with each other and that also respect the tile grid. The gif below shows this in action as the blue outlines are the physics bodies and there's always a slight mismatch between them and the rooms since their position is always being rounded:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/eyTNcXE.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>One issue that might come up is when you want to have rooms that are skewed horizontally or vertically. For instance, consider the game I'm working on:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/COnbUTF.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Combat is very horizontally oriented and so I probably want to have most rooms being bigger in width than they are in height. The problem with this lies in how the physics engine decides to resolve its collisions whenever long rooms are near each other:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VbvngEZ.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the dungeon becomes very tall, which is not ideal. To fix this we can spawn rooms initially inside a thin strip instead of on a circle. This ensures that the dungeon itself will have a decent width to height ratio:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yMEwhwr.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>To spawn randomly inside this strip we can just change the `getRandomPointInCircle` function to spawn points inside an ellipse instead (in the gif above I used <em>ellipse_width = 400</em> and <em>ellipse_height = 20</em>):</p>
<pre><code>function getRandomPointInEllipse(ellipse_width, ellipse_height)
  local t = 2*math.pi*math.random()
  local u = math.random()+math.random()
  local r = nil
  if u &gt; 1 then r = 2-u else r = u end
  return roundm(ellipse_width*r*math.cos(t)/2, tile_size), 
         roundm(ellipse_height*r*math.sin(t)/2, tile_size)
end
</code></pre>
<h2 id="main-rooms"><a class="header" href="#main-rooms">Main Rooms</a></h2>
<p>The next step simply determines which rooms are main/hub rooms and which ones aren't. TKdev's approach here is pretty solid: just pick rooms that are above some width/height threshold. For the gif below the threshold I used was <em>1.25*mean</em>, meaning, if <em>width_mean</em> and <em>height_mean</em> are 24 then rooms with width and height bigger than 30 will be selected.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yeqXkTe.gif" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="delaunay-triangulation--graph"><a class="header" href="#delaunay-triangulation--graph">Delaunay Triangulation + Graph</a></h2>
<p>Now we take all the midpoints of the selected rooms and feed that into the Delaunay procedure. You either implement this procedure yourself or find someone else who's done it and shared the source. In my case I got lucky and <a href="https://github.com/Yonaba/delaunay">Yonaba already implemented it</a>. As you can see from that interface, it takes in points and spits out triangles:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BUeRTaW.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>After you have the triangles you can then generate a graph. This procedure should be fairly simple provided you have a graph data structure/library at hand. In case you weren't doing this already, it's useful that your Room objects/structures have unique ids to them so that you can add those ids to the graph instead of having to copy them around.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-spanning-tree"><a class="header" href="#minimum-spanning-tree">Minimum Spanning Tree</a></h2>
<p>After this we generate a minimum spanning tree from the graph. Again, either implement this yourself or find someone who's done it in your language of choice.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gc77fqU.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>The minimum spanning tree will ensure that all main rooms in the dungeon are reachable but also will make it so that they're not all connected as before. This is useful because by default we usually don't want a super connected dungeon but we also don't want unreachable islands. However, we also usually don't want a dungeon that only has one linear path, so what we do now is add a few edges back from the Delaunay graph:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Spogz4z.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>This will add a few more paths and loops and will make the dungeon more interesting. TKdev arrived at 15% of edges being added back and I found that around 8-10% was a better value. This may vary depending on how connected you want the dungeon to be in the end.</p>
<h2 id="hallways"><a class="header" href="#hallways">Hallways</a></h2>
<p>For the final part we want to add hallways to the dungeon. To do this we go through each node in the graph and then for each other node that connects to it we create lines between them. If the nodes are horizontally close enough (their <em>y</em> position is similar) then we create a horizontal line. If the nodes are vertically close enough then we create a vertical line. If the nodes are not close together either horizontally or vertically then we create 2 lines forming an L shape. </p>
<p>The test that I used for what ~close enough~ means calculates the midpoint between both nodes' positions and checks to see if that midpoint's <em>x or y</em> attributes are inside the node's boundaries. If they are then I create the line from that midpoint's position. If they aren't then I create two lines, both going from the source's midpoint to the target's midpoint but only in one axis.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iKR57gS.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the picture above you can see examples of all cases. Nodes 62 and 47 have a horizontal line between them, nodes 60 and 125 have a vertical one and nodes 118 and 119 have an L shape. It's also important to note that those aren't the only lines I'm creating. They are the only ones I'm drawing but I'm also creating 2 additional lines to the side of each one spaced by <em>tile_size</em>, since I want my corridors to be at least 3 tiles wide in either width or height.</p>
<p>Anyway, after this we check to see which rooms that aren't main/hub rooms that collide with each of the lines. Colliding rooms are then added to whatever structure you're using to hold all this by now and they will serve as the skeleton for the hallways:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Y7E7Egn.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Depending on the uniformity and size of the rooms that you initially set you'll get different looking dungeons here. If you want your hallways to be more uniform and less weird looking then you should aim for low standard deviation and you should put some checks in place to keep rooms from being too skinny one way or the other.</p>
<p>For the last step we simply add 1 tile sized grid cells to make up the missing parts. Note that you don't actually need a grid data structure or anything too fancy, you can just go through each line according to the tile size and add grid rounded positions (that will correspond to a 1 tile sized cell) to some list. This is where having 3 (or more) lines happening instead of only 1 matters.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bSV1gpV.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/t4G5oRK.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>And then after this we're done!</p>
<h2 id="end"><a class="header" href="#end">END</a></h2>
<p>The data structures I returned from this entire procedure were: a list of rooms (each room is just a structure with a unique id, x/y positions and width/height); the graph, where each node points to a room id and the edges have the distance between rooms in tiles; and then an actual 2D grid, where each cell can be nothing (meaning its empty), can point to a main/hub room, can point to a hallway room or can be hallway cell. With these 3 structures I think it's possible to get any type of data you could want out of the layout and then you can figure out where to place doors, enemies, items, which rooms should have bosses, and so on.</p>

<p><a href="https://straypixels.net/assets/layoutgroup-animation/objectives_animation_2.webm">There's supposed to be a video here, but your browser doesn't support the video tag!</a></p>
<p>Imagine the following scenario: you have a list of objectives you want to show in the game HUD. Sounds simple enough to implement in Unity’s built-in UI system, right? Just throw a <code>HorizontalLayoutGroup</code> on a panel, insert your elements, and the panel will automatically size to fit. Instantiate new children as new objectives come in.</p>
<p>However, when you add new objectives, it doesn’t look especially nice to have the UI expand immediately. Plus, you want to draw the player’s attention to the objectives list when it is updated. So, you decide to animate the objectives list.</p>
<p>Using Unity’s built-in UI components, this turns out to be a bit difficult to do. There is no built-in support for animation in the UI system. How, then, do we go about animating this list?</p>
<p>One way to do it is to simply throw away Unity’s layout engine altogether, and only use their components for display/events. This is a perfectly valid way to go about it, and in fact is necessary if you want more control over how the animation is done. However, one of my main goals was to leverage Unity’s layout engine somehow.</p>
<p>Another way is to follow <a href="https://answers.unity.com/questions/1156668/is-there-a-way-to-animate-dynamic-layout-group-cha.html">the technique laid out in this answer</a>. In summary, they create a hidden hierarchy for layout, and the “real” UI interpolates to the match the size of the hidden hierarchy over time. This sounds like a reasonable approach, but seems a little clunky to me in terms of setup.</p>
<p>Where, then, does that leave us?</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to insert elements directly into the <code>LayoutGroup</code>, and for those elements to begin at no size.</li>
<li>But we still want Unity to tell us what size those elements <em>should</em> be, when they’re at full size.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few tricks I used to pull this off. Most of it is contained within the way I’ve organized the hierarchy:</p>
<p><img src="https://straypixels.net/assets/layoutgroup-animation/Hierarchy.png" alt="Unity hierarchy. ObjectivesContainer contains Header and SingleObjectiveContainer. SingleObjectiveContainer contains ObjectiveText." /></p>
<p>The parent, the <code>ObjectivesContainer</code>, has a <code>VerticalLayoutGroup</code>, along with a <code>ContentSizeFitter</code> so that it always snugly fits its children:</p>
<p><img src="https://straypixels.net/assets/layoutgroup-animation/ObjectivesContainerInspector.png" alt="ObjectivesContainer inspector." /></p>
<p>In a traditional <code>VerticalLayoutGroup</code> setup, we’d put the row content directly under <code>ObjectivesContainer</code>. However, you might have noticed that <code>ObjectiveText</code> is not in <code>ObjectivesContainer</code>; instead, it’s been placed under <code>SingleObjectiveContainer</code>. Here’s the inspector for <code>SingleObjectiveContainer</code> (on the left) and <code>ObjectiveText</code> (on the right):</p>
<p><img src="https://straypixels.net/assets/layoutgroup-animation/InspectorsSideBySide.png" alt="Two inspectors side by side." /></p>
<p>The important thing here is that the SingleObjectiveContainer has a <code>LayoutElement</code> component. This allows us to shrink the row without affecting the size of the content inside of the row, by modifying the <code>preferredWidth</code> and <code>preferredHeight</code> properties.</p>
<p>You might also note that there is a <code>ContentSizeFitter</code> on the content element, with both “Horizontal Fit” and “Vertical Fit” to “Preferred Size”. We could not do this without the container element, as Unity’s layout system must control the size of its direct children. We’ll discuss what we use this for later.</p>
<p>One last thing to call your attention to: the anchor of the <code>ObjectiveText</code> is set to the bottom-left. This is done so our text sticks to the bottom-side of the container, so that when we animate, the text appears to drop downwards. (Try playing around with the anchor after the effect is finished and you’ll see what I mean.)</p>
<p>With this configuration, we can now modify the values on the <code>SingleObjectiveContainer</code>’s <code>LayoutGroup</code> and have the <code>ObjectivesContainer</code> follow:</p>
<p><img src="https://straypixels.net/assets/layoutgroup-animation/HeightSettingNoMask.gif" alt="Me adjusting the preferred height of the LayoutElement." /></p>
<p>Obviously, row content showing behind other elements is undesirable. We can solve this by adding an Image component and a Mask component to the container. Make sure to uncheck “Show Mask Graphic”; the <code>Image</code> component is only there to define the mask boundaries, and shouldn’t be drawn.</p>
<p><img src="https://straypixels.net/assets/layoutgroup-animation/MaskInspector.png" alt="A mask component with an Image component." /></p>
<p>With the mask, only the portion text that fits within the container is shown:</p>
<p><img src="https://straypixels.net/assets/layoutgroup-animation/HeightSettingWithMask.gif" alt="Me adjusting the preferred height of the LayoutElement after the mask is applied." /></p>
<p>We now have all the tools we need to do the animation. For the insertion animation, we’ll animate the container from (0,0) to the size of the size of the inner content’s <code>RectTransform</code>. Since the content’s <code>RectTransform</code> is being controlled by a <code>ContentSizeFitter</code>, that means we’ll animate to the exact size needed to fit the inner content snugly.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>ContentSizeFitter</code> isn’t special; you could set the width and height of the content in other ways, such as by using an <code>AspectRatioFitter</code>, and this technique will work just as well. The important part is simply that we’re using the inner content’s size as the animation target, so it should be set to something reasonable.</p>
<p>I’ve done the animation using a <code>Coroutine</code> in code (though I’m sure there’s better ways to do it):</p>
<pre><code class="language-cs">IEnumerator ShowSelf(float duration)
{
    float startHeight = rectTransform.rect.height;
    float endHeight = text.rectTransform.rect.height;
    float startWidth = rectTransform.rect.width;
    float endWidth = text.rectTransform.rect.width;

    float time = 0.0f;
    while (time &lt; duration)
    {
        // Adding easing to the animation makes the animation much more fluid, compared to
        // a standard linear interpolation; see the repository below for the implementation
        layoutElement.preferredHeight = Util.EaseInOut(startHeight, endHeight, time, duration);
        layoutElement.preferredWidth = Util.EaseInOut(startWidth, endWidth, time, duration);

        yield return null;
        time += Time.deltaTime;
    }

    layoutElement.preferredHeight = endHeight;
    layoutElement.preferredWidth = endWidth;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A hiding animation is similar - all you need to do is reverse the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> parameters.</p>
<p>After adding code for instantiating some prefabs, the result is what you see here:</p>
<p><img src="https://straypixels.net/assets/layoutgroup-animation/FinalResult.gif" alt="ObjectivesContainer inspector." /></p>
<p>Looking at it closely, there’s still room for improvement. The width of the rows appears to animate more quickly than the height, since we’re animating to 0 and not the edge of the container. This turns out to be a bit tricky to solve since the edge of the container could change in the middle of the animation. Still, this is good enough for something like the objectives list described above, since the user’s eyes won’t be focusing on it most of the time.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Chaosed0/LayoutGroupAnimation">Here is a git repository containing a demonstration Unity project</a>. This is what I used to create the final result gif above.

<ul>
<li>Made by another developer in the team which allowed the programmer to mass import the assets from the art team in seconds</li>
<li>For it to work, assets had to be standardized, which meant that the export side should also be automated</li>

<li>While faster for the programmer to import, it also sped up the artists which ended up with more unused assets

<ol>
<li>New tasks go to the inbox and are evaluated next meeting -- avoids being derailed by unplanned work
<ul>
<li>New tasks always go to the inbox first and cannot be put into any other list</li>
<li>Each production meeting evaluates the inbox and decides the priority</li>
<li>This meant everybody knew what the next two days of work looked like</li>
<li>New tasks do not interfere other's work because they are not yet evaluated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Time is a constraint, not a flexible resource. Avoids burnout and crunch.
<ul>
<li>Only 16 hours of work can be handed to any one person during that sprint</li>
<li>Exceeding demands that person to crunch</li>
<li>Refusing to crunch is the core way to bake quality into the production pipeline</li>

<p>Hi, my name is Jolo. I am currently a game development student residing at Lipa, Batangas. I mostly make games in Unity, but I also tend to check out other tech in my free time. Aside from game development, in my free time I play video games (obviously), read manga, watch vtubers, and learn more about tech both in hardware and software.</p>
